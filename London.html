      <hr>
      <img src="IMG/London/London_eye.JPG" height="485" width="730" style="float: right">
      <p>The London Eye is centrally located in the heart of the capital, gracefully rotating over the river Thames opposite the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.
            At 135 metres, the London Eye is one of the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheels; a feat of design and engineering it has become the modern symbol representing the capital and a global icon.
            The experience showcases breathtaking 360-degree views of the capital and its famous landmarks.
            The gradual rotation in one of the 32 high-tech glass capsules takes approximately 30 minutes and gives you an ever-changing perspective of London.
            Within each capsule, interactive guides allow you to explore the capital's iconic landmarks in several languages.
            An experience on the London Eye will lift you high enough to see up to 40 kilometres on a clear day and keep you close enough to see the spectacular details of the city unfolding beneath you.</p>
