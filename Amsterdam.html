<h3>The Rijksmuseum</h3>
</nav>
<hr>
      <img src="IMG/Amsterdam/netherlands-amsterdam-attractions-the-rijksmuseum.JPG" height="485" width="730" style="float: right">
      <p>One of Amsterdam's most popular attractions - and certainly its most important art repository - the Rijksmuseum was founded in 1809 to house the country's huge collection of rare art and antiquities. The museum's impressive collection includes some seven million works of art, among them more than 5,000 important paintings spread across 250 rooms of this sprawling building. In addition to its paintings, the Rijksmuseum boasts a well-stocked library of more than 35,000 books and manuscripts, as well as numerous fascinating displays dealing with the development of art and culture in the Netherlands. Of special note are its collections of traditional handicrafts, medieval sculpture, and modern art styles. A variety of themed English language guided tours are available. For a special experience, try the fun art history canal cruise taking in many of the sites represented in the Rijksmuseum's collections.

<h3>The Anne Frank Museum</h3>
</nav>
<hr>
      <img src="IMG/Amsterdam/Annefrank.JPG" height="485" width="730" style="float: left">
      <p>On the Prinsengracht, the Anne Frank Museum is dedicated to the all-too-short life of one of the world's best-known Holocaust victims. In the actual home in which Anne's family hid for much of WWII - they were Jewish refugees from the German city of Frankfurt - Anne wrote the diary that became an international bestseller after the war, just a few years after her death at age 15 (she died just two months before the war ended). Much of the home has been kept as it was during Anne's time, and it serves as a poignant monument to a tragic period of history.

          Next door to the Anne Frank Museum, Amsterdam's West Church (Westerkerk) is one of the most popular churches in the city. Completed in 1630, this Renaissance church is unusual due to its many internal and external Gothic features. Its 85-meter tower, popularly known as "Langer Jan" (tall John), is the highest in the city, and on the tip of its spire is a large replica of the emperor's crown, placed there in memory of Emperor Maximilian of Austria. Inside the tower, a carillon proclaims the hours. Other highlights include a fine organ dating from 1622, along with an interesting marble column placed there in 1906 in memory of Rembrandt, who was buried outside the church (he was later reinterred inside the church).

  <h3>The Van Gogh Museum</h3>
  </nav>
  <hr>
        <img src="IMG/Amsterdam/Vangogh.JPG" height="485" width="730" style="float: right">
        <p>A must-visit for art fans and historians, the spectacular Van Gogh Museum has been one of Amsterdam's top attractions since it opened in 1972. Dedicated to the often troubled life and extraordinary artistry of one of the country's most-revered painters, this modern Gerrit Rietveld-designed structure is home to the world's largest collection of Van Gogh paintings and artifacts, much of it donated by his brother, Theo, and other family members. Boasting an impressive 200 paintings, 500 etchings and drawings, as well as 700 letters written to (and by) friends and family, the collection is split into key periods of the artist's life: his realistic works (1880 to 1887), including the famous The Potato Eaters, and his Impressionist period from 1887 to 1890, which saw the creation of perhaps his best-known work, Vase with Sunflowers. Also of interest are works by Van Gogh's contemporaries, including such leading artists as Paul Gauguin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. If time allows, be sure to check the availability of the museum's educational workshops in such disciplines as painting and photography.</p>

        <h3>The Jordaan (neighborhood)</h3>

        <img src="IMG/Amsterdam/the_jordan.JPG" height="485" width="730" style="float: left">
        <p>The Jordaan is the most popular of Amsterdam's neighborhoods, known for its mix of residential areas with garden courtyards, lively markets, and upscale boutiques and eateries. Tourists could easily spend a day simply wandering the picturesque streets, but the area is also home to plenty of things to do. Known to most as the home of the Anne Frank Museum, the area is also home to lesser-known treasures like the Woonboots Museum, a floating museum dedicated to houseboats. On Saturday mornings, Lindengracht turns into a huge open-air market, where you can find local crafts, produce, flowers, and goodies perfect for filling a picnic basket. Monday mornings, it is Westerstraat that fills with 200 vendors' stalls, this time selling a wide range of goods in a flea-market-style bazaar. The Jordaan's restaurants and cafes have become the trendy place to sit and people-watch while enjoying traditional Dutch folk music</p>

        <h3>Vondelpark</h3>
        </nav>
        <hr>
        <img src="IMG/Amsterdam/Yondelpark.JPG" height="485" width="730" style="float: right">
        <p>The largest and most visited park in Amsterdam, Vondelpark occupies 116 acres, which contain many things to see and do. In addition to expanses of green space dotted by peaceful ponds and traversed by ample paths, the park is home to a rose garden featuring more than 70 types of the flower. It also has a variety of sculptures and statues, playgrounds, and other recreational facilities, including rollerblade rental and the Vondelpark Open Air Theater, which serves as a venue for musical and stage productions from May through September. It you haven't packed a picnic, don't worry - the park is also full of cafes where you can enjoy a snack or a full meal. As in any large city, after-dark visits to the park are not recommended.</p>
